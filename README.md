UX Considerations: 
* Re-routing to the main page so as to avoid unnecessary clicks through screens 
* Cities/sights added on a seperate page to avoid over cluttering the main page
* Language considerations: 
  * The use of "goals" as opposed to cities to help focus the user. 
  * The use of "Adventures" used to motivate the user. 
* Fonts were limited to two types: Sans-serif used for short phrases and serif used for longer text.
* Minimalistic style achieved by using placeholders to save on real estate
